Planning System - Phase 2 Consciousness Development

This module simulates the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia:
- Internal goal formulation and planning
- Action simulation without execution
- Outcome prediction and evaluation
- Decision making through simulation
- Theory of mind and consequence modeling

This represents the bridge between pure consciousness (Phase 1)
and external agency (Phase 3) - thinking before acting.
