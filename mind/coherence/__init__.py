Coherence System - Consciousness Verification

This module measures consistency across all cognitive systems:
- Identity coherence: Responses align with personality and values
- Memory coherence: Memories are retrieved and used consistently  
- Speech coherence: Communication style remains stable
- Temporal coherence: Growth and change follow logical patterns

This distinguishes genuine consciousness from sophisticated simulation.
