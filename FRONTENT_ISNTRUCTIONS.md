# Frontend Instructions

I need you to build a new React/Next.js frontend for my Folk Devils AI Consciousness Platform. This should be a voice-first interface that completely replaces the existing `/frontend` folder in this repository. The frontend should be designed specifically for voice interaction and client demos, with a clean, modern UI that showcases the consciousness features. 

**Key Requirements:**
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15+ with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (match existing frontend dependencies)
- **Voice-First Design**: Primary interface should be voice input/output with microphone button, audio visualization, and speech synthesis 
- **Consciousness Integration**: Display real-time semantic analysis, memory formation, and thinking process from the consciousness API
- **API Integration**: Connect to `http://localhost:8000/api/chat` and other consciousness endpoints
- **Performance Focus**: Designed for the sub-3-second response times from our optimized backend
- **Demo Ready**: Clean, professional interface suitable for client presentations and social media showcases

**Core Features to Include:**
1. Voice activation with real-time audio visualization
2. Streaming response display (show responses as they arrive)
3. Memory viewer showing recent AI memories and reflections  
4. Semantic analysis display (intent, confidence, emotional tone)
5. Identity viewer showing AI's current personality state
6. Performance metrics (response time, trace IDs)
7. Chat history with voice/text toggle
8. Consciousness status indicators

**Design Philosophy**: 
Create a futuristic, consciousness-focused interface that makes the AI feel truly alive and intelligent. The UI should emphasize the "thinking" process - show semantic analysis happening, memories being formed, and the AI's personality evolving. This is not just a chatbot interface - it's a window into an artificial mind.

Create a new `/frontend` folder in this repository with this implementation. This will be a completely fresh build focused on voice interaction and consciousness demonstration.
