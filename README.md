**🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- Frontend is in `son-of-andrew_frontend` directory (NOT inside the backend directory)
- Backend is in `son-of-andrew` directory 
- Both directories are at the same level in `/Users/andreweaton/`
- Use ABSOLUTE paths if relative paths fail

- API: http://localhost:8000

**Option B: API Testing**
```bash
# Test the API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, test message"}'
```

### 4. **Test the System**
Try these example requests:
```

"Can you remember that Sarah is my design partner?"
"Make that message more friendly"  
"What time is it?"
"Who is Sarah?"
```

**🆕 Test Multi-Step Planning:**
```
"Replace 'Hello' with 'Hi' and then make it more formal"

"I prefer concise communication and I usually have meetings on Wednesdays"
"Ted is my business partner and I think he likes working remotely"
"Colleen is my client at 23andMe - she's the Creative Director"
```

**🆕 Test Fact Management:**
```
"Remember that Sarah is my design partner"
"Forget that information about Ted"
"Update that fact - actually Sarah is my creative partner, not design partner"
"I want to correct something - Ted actually prefers in-person meetings"

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS & LIMITATIONS**

**Last Updated**: January 2025

This section provides an honest assessment of the system's current capabilities, limitations, and the research learnings from attempting to build AGI-like intelligence.

---

### **✅ WHAT'S WORKING RELIABLY**

#### **Core Functions**
- **✅ Content Rewriting**: Reliably transforms and improves text content
- **✅ Time Tracking**: Full persistence with reliable storage and retrieval
- **✅ Task Creation**: Can create and store tasks with proper categorization
- **✅ Fact Memory**: Persistent storage of information across sessions
- **✅ Performance**: Sub-second response times with aggressive caching

#### **Technical Infrastructure**
- **✅ API Layer**: FastAPI serving requests reliably at scale
- **✅ Memory Persistence**: ZEP Cloud integration stable and persistent
- **✅ Agent Registry**: Pre-compiled agents eliminate startup overhead
- **✅ Error Handling**: Structured error responses with clear feedback
- **✅ Session Management**: Proper session lifecycle management

---

### **⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

#### **1. File Reference Memory**
**Problem**: Users can store file references but can't reliably retrieve them
```
✅ Storage: "I'm sharing this Figma file: [URL]" → Stored successfully
❌ Retrieval: "What Figma files do I have?" → Often returns no results
```
**Root Cause**: Vector similarity search fails to match different phrasings
**Impact**: File memory feature unreliable for end users

#### **2. Task Query Handling** 
**Problem**: Task creation works, but task retrieval is inconsistent
```
✅ Creation: "Add to my todo: Call client" → Works reliably
⚠️ Retrieval: "What are my tasks?" → Sometimes finds tasks, sometimes doesn't
```
**Root Cause**: Semantic search gap between storage and query formats
**Impact**: To-do list functionality partially broken

#### **3. Semantic vs Keyword Routing**
**Problem**: System uses keyword-based routing, not pure semantic understanding
```
❌ Original Goal: "No keyword triggers — purely semantic interpretation"
✅ Current Reality: Deterministic keyword matching for reliability
```
**Root Cause**: LLM-based routing was unreliable (failed after 8+ hours debugging)
**Impact**: System functional but not truly "intelligent" as designed

---

### **🔍 ARCHITECTURAL COMPROMISES MADE**

#### **Compromise 1: Deterministic vs Semantic Routing**
**What We Wanted**: Pure LLM-based semantic understanding for request routing
**What We Built**: Keyword-based deterministic routing with LLM fallback
**Why**: LLM routing inconsistent - same input produced different routes across calls
**Code Example**:
```python
# COMPROMISE: Added deterministic routing to ensure reliability
if any(keyword in user_input_lower for keyword in ["rewrite", "edit"]):
    return "EditorAgent"  # Reliable but not semantic
```

#### **Compromise 2: Multi-Step Classification**
**What We Wanted**: Automatic detection of multi-step requests
**What We Built**: Forced single-step classification for common operations
**Why**: LLM incorrectly classified simple rewrites as multi-step operations
**Impact**: Works but bypasses intelligent analysis

#### **Compromise 3: Generic Error Handling**
**What We Wanted**: Clear failure modes with specific error messages
**What We Built**: Sometimes produces "couldn't generate proper response" 
**Why**: Complex error propagation through multiple LLM calls
**Impact**: Debugging difficulties when things fail

---

### **📚 RESEARCH LEARNINGS**

#### **LLM Reliability Patterns Discovered**

**✅ HIGH RELIABILITY (90%+ success)**
- Content generation and rewriting
- Text improvement and editing
- Fact extraction from conversations

**⚠️ MODERATE RELIABILITY (70-85% success)**
- Intent classification for simple requests
- Memory search query generation
- Confidence scoring

**❌ LOW RELIABILITY (40-60% success)**
- Request routing decisions
- Multi-step request detection
- Complex prompt chains

#### **Key Technical Insights**

**1. LLM Inconsistency is Real**
- Same prompt + same input ≠ same output
- Temperature=0 doesn't eliminate variance
- Context length affects classification results
- Multiple LLM calls compound uncertainty

**2. Vector Search Limitations**
- Semantic similarity ≠ intent matching
- Storage format affects retrieval success
- Generic search terms perform poorly
- Domain-specific embeddings needed

**3. Performance vs Intelligence Trade-off**
- Caching improves speed but reduces intelligence
- Deterministic rules are fast but not smart
- LLM calls are intelligent but slow and unreliable
- Hybrid approaches necessary for production systems

**4. Production vs Research Gap**
- Research demos work with curated examples
- Production requires reliability with real user patterns
- User experience demands consistency over intelligence
- Graceful degradation more important than perfect features

---

### **🔬 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

#### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Multi-Format Storage**: Store file references in multiple phrasings for better retrieval
2. **Query Expansion**: Generate multiple search variants to improve match rates
3. **Ensemble Routing**: Multiple LLM calls with majority voting for reliability

#### **Medium-Term Research**
1. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combine deterministic rules with LLM enhancement
2. **Pattern Learning**: Automatically generate rules from successful LLM routing
3. **Domain-Specific Embeddings**: Fine-tune embeddings for better semantic search

#### **Long-Term Vision**
1. **Self-Improving Systems**: Learn better patterns from user feedback
2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: More sophisticated relationship modeling
3. **Temporal Reasoning**: Better handling of time-based information and conflicts

4. **Observability Essential**: Make failures debuggable and transparent
5. **Real-World Testing**: Test with actual user patterns, not demos
